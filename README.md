- 👋 Yo, I am named Xenn. I like the concept of an ever permutating holding pattern, hence @foldingpattern
- 👀 I’m interested in ... all manner of visually gratifying aesthetics and pleasureable fun
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... intuitively, though some may say haphazardly
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... projects and partys. hit me up
- 📫 How to reach me ... corporeal meat in the Smug Hermit Kingdom of Aotearoa (AKA NZ). But outsize of meat space, well, you just wait. Watch how I emerge and omnipermeate (strange looking compound word, I concede, so omnipervade if omnipermeation takes no purchase in your mind)
